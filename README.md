# Password Security Checker

A beginner-friendly cybersecurity project that teaches password security fundamentals through hands-on analysis.

## What This Project Taught Me

- **Real Attack Scenarios**: Learn how hackers actually crack passwords
- **Vulnerability Analysis**: Understand what makes passwords weak or strong  
- **Risk Assessment**: See mathematical proof of why certain passwords are dangerous
- **Security Best Practices**: Learn industry-standard password requirements

##  Live Demo

##  Educational Features

### Password Strength Analysis
- Real-time strength scoring based on cybersecurity principles
- Character set diversity analysis
- Length vs. complexity trade-offs

### Attack Simulation
- **Dictionary Attacks**: Tests against common password databases
- **Brute Force Timing**: Calculates actual crack times
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies predictable sequences

### Vulnerability Detection
- Common password identification
- Personal information risks (birth years, names)
- Repeated character patterns
- Sequential patterns (123, abc, qwe)
